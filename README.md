Some examples of my work

The goal of the capstone project was to predict secondary market markups for out of print comics and graphic novels.
The Capstone_Dataset_Generation file requires truall.csv and trulow.csv to function. It also requires an active API key for ISBN database. The output of that program is dfall.p and dflow.p which Capstone_Analysis requires.

The goal of the magic card classification project was to classify cards by their role in a deck using the card text
Magic_Card_Classification requires IS.data and y.data to run.
